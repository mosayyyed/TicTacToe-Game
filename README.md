# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮

This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Dart.

## Description ℹ️

In this Tic-Tac-Toe game, two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## How to Play 🕹️

1. Run the program.
2. The program will display an empty 3x3 grid.
3. Players take turns entering the position where they want to place their mark (X or O). Positions are numbered from 1 to 9, as shown below:
   
    ```
     1 | 2 | 3 
    ---|---|---
     4 | 5 | 6 
    ---|---|---
     7 | 8 | 9 
    ```
   
4. The game ends when one player achieves three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when all spaces on the board are filled.
